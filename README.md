# Discrete Time Signals and Systems (ECE 340) Labs

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB and LaTeX code written for the Discrete Time Signals and Systems (ECE 340) course. The labs in this collection focus on fundamental concepts in signal processing, including discrete-time systems, convolution, sampling, Z-transforms, and filtering.
## Labs Overview
### Lab 0: Introduction to MATLAB

This lab introduces the MATLAB environment and covers basic operations such as matrix manipulation, plotting, and simple computations. It serves as a foundation for the subsequent labs.

### Lab 1: Introduction to Discrete-Time Signals and Systems

In this lab, I explored key MATLAB functionalities, including plotting multiple 1-D functions on a single figure, reading and writing audio signals in .wav format, and handling digital images in .jpg format. Additionally, I analyzed system response by calculating and visualizing the output of discrete-time systems. These tasks provided foundational skills for working with multimedia data and simulating signal processing systems.
### Lab 2: Convolution, Sampling, and Aliasing

### Lab 3: Z-Transform and Transform Analysis of LTI Systems

### Lab 4: Spectrum Estimation of Multimedia Signals

### Lab 5: Filtering Multimedia Signals Using an FIR Filter

## How to Use

- **MATLAB:** All MATLAB scripts are self-contained and can be run directly in the MATLAB environment.
- **LaTeX:** Each lab includes a LaTeX report that documents the theory, results, and analysis of the experiments conducted in MATLAB. To compile the LaTeX files, use any LaTeX editor (e.g., TeXShop, Overleaf, etc.).

## Requirements
- MATLAB R2021a or later
- A LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX) for compiling the reports
